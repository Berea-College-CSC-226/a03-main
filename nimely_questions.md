### SECTION 2

     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   `To set the turtle's speed to a maximum speed, you use the "turtle.speed('fastest')" command.`

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 
`To chnage the turtle's color to xanadu, you use the turtle.color("xanadu")`

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?
`To fill a shape with the color xanadu, you first start by using the command turtle.fillcolor('xanadu')  to  fill a shape with the color xanadu before starting to draw the shape. Then, turtle.begin_fill() before drawing the shape and turtle.end_fill() after you finish drawing it`

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

`when you clone a repo, you copy a project from GitHub to your computer so you can work on it locally.`


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

`A repository is a place where your projectâ€™s code is stored. It exists on both your computer (after cloning) and GitHub (online).`


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

``` A commit saves changes to your code. A commit message explains what changes were made, making it easier to track and understand updates.```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

``` Pushing you code means uploading your changes from your local computer to the remote repository on GitHub. Your code is being pushed from your local machine to the GitHub server.```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

``` When you pull before you push, it allow you to see any changes that has been made to ensure that your code is up to date.```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
    Replace this text with your answer
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```

```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    Replace this text with your answer
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations

## SECTION 5
- A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully 
  understanding them. Your last task is to formulate a question and ask it. 
  To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the instructor 
  will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:
