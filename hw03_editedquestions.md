Please replace each `Replace this text with your answer` 
with your answer to the question above.

## SECTION 1: 

1.a. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color purple. 
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
    R = 130 G = 0 B = 140, Hex # = 82008C
```

1.b. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color brown. 
     What are the R, G, and B values? 

```
    R = 165 G = 78 B = 20, Hex # = A54E14
```

1.c. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color xanadu. 
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
    This one was difficult as I had no clue what a xanadu was. Looks green/grey
    R = 115 G = 137 B = 124, Hex # = 73897C
```

### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
    Instead of forward, the method can be shortened to just fd.
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
    turtle.pos() will return the turtles current position.
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    turtle.speed(10) will set turtle to the maximum speed.
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    turtle.color("xanadu")
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
    turtle.fillcolor("xanadu")
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    Cloning is taking the blank assignment from our repository (copy/paste) and sending to to Pycharm so that we may be able to edit it.
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    The repository essentially is the database where we can find and clone our assignments onto Pycharm, it's located on Github.
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    Commit is basically saving what you've done on Pycharm to your local machine.
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    Push is how you take the committed work on Pycharm and shoot it to Github to be graded.
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    It is important to pull as most times you will be working as a team and don't want to accidentally overwrite someone elses work, so therefore pulling will help.
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
    I see a total of 114 branches al with different names, but seeing as I haven't pushed mine yet I don't have a branch.
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    the master branch says next to it that it is the orgin/master branch and there are a couple
    more options such as merging master into my branch name.
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    This left me a little confused as to if anything even happened. The most I saw was that the "workplace" was
    restored as I moved back into the master branch.
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    Yes, my file is still there however I'm not sure how branching could be useful this way. Regardless of
    whatever branch I'm in, I can edit it and those edits will appear in the other branch.
```

## SECTION 5
- A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully 
  understanding them. Your last task is to formulate a question and ask it. 
  To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the instructor 
  will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:
