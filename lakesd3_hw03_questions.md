## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    it copies code so it can be changed and altered while not having any effect on main
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    All your code in github is being stored there where more people in the github section can see it.
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    when you commit while coding it will save any work you did up to that point
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    Pushing your code will put your code and any modifications onto the repo
```

## SECTION 5
- A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully 
  understanding them. Your last task is to formulate a question and ask it. 
  To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the instructor 
  will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:
