## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    Take from remote source and put it localy. 
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    A repository is a storage space for the project, it has all the files, folders and history of changes we made.
    On Github, the repo exists online where we can access them and that is the remote repository.
    On the machine, you have to clone to create a copy on your computer and that is local repository
    
    
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
 A commit is like saving a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time.
 When you make changes to your project, you use a commit to record those changes in the repository.
 Git by default requires commit messages because in software development,
 it is necessary to communicate with other people and commit message is a best way to communicate. 
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
Pushing your code means sending the changes youâ€™ve made on your local machine to the remote repository like on GitHub.
Your code is from the local machine where you have made al the chages and push it to github, where your project is hosted. 
.

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
To ensure you repo is update that way you can avoid conflits with others, stay update and smoth collaboratio. 
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
They are two branch on my repo, they are the masters and the unsername that i created.
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
 Yes they are.On the master branch, you have multiply options, while on the branch that I created,
 I only have few options, like changing my name, show diff with working Tree and update. 
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
My files still there, nothing changed, they are all the same.     
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
 Branches are usefull, you can work on multiples branches without interfering with each other's work.     
```
