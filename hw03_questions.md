### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
    Move the turtle forward by the specified distance, in the direction the turtle is headed.
    turtle.fd(distance)
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
    turtle.position() or turtle.pos() returns the turtle’s current location (x,y) 
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    turtle.speed('fastest')
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    turtle.color(115, 134, 119)
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
    turtle.fillcolor(115, 134, 119)
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    Making  a local copy of the collaborative project on your device
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    Is your collaborative project; all data of your project is saved in a repository
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    tagging changes, or revisions, in a document
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    saves your changes on Github’s servers
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    Avoiding conflicts
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
    11 branches. I see others and mine.
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    Yes. I have one more hw03_melnichenkaa.py file
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    the file that was unique to your branch may disappear from the Project pane
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
        Yes, the file reappears when you switch back to your branch
```

## SECTION 5
- A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully 
  understanding them. Your last task is to formulate a question and ask it. 
  To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the instructor 
  will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:
