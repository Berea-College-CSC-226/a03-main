Please replace each `Replace this text with your answer` 
with your answer to the question above.

## SECTION 1: 

1.a. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color purple. 
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
    R:128, G:0, B:128
```

1.b. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color brown.

      R:115, G:130, B:120

```

### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?
```
The alternate command to move the turtle forward is turtle.fd().
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
    The command to print the turtle's current location is turtle.pos().
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    To set the turtle's speed to maximum, use the command turtle.speed(0).
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    turtle.colormode(255)
    turtle.color(115, 134, 120)
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
    turtle.colormode(255)
    turtle.color(115, 134, 120)
    turtle.begin_fill()
    turtle.whatevershape(50)
    turtle.end_fill()
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    Cloning a repo means copying a remote repository to your local machine for offline work.
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    A repository is a storage space for code, project files, and version history. It can exist both on GitHub (remote) and on your local machine (local).
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    A commit is a saved change or snapshot of the project's files in a Git repository. A commit message is needed to describe the changes made, helping others (and yourself) understand the purpose of the commit.
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    To push your code means to upload your local changes to a remote repository, like GitHub. Your code is being pushed from your local machine to the remote repository.
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    
It is important to pull before you push to ensure your local repository is up to date with any changes made by others in the remote repository, preventing conflicts and ensuring your push integrates smoothly.
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
    I see 135 branches, I see myself and many others.
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    Yes, mine has my phyton file that I wrote my giraffe code on.
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
   My file is still here, I did not notice any changes due to my pull request at the start of me working on these questions.
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    Yes my file is still here. Branching is useful because it allows me to work on new features, experiments, or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. I can make changes in a separate branch, and once everything works as expected, I can merge it back into the main branch. This keeps the project stable and helps manage different versions of the code.
```

## SECTION 5
- A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully 
  understanding them. Your last task is to formulate a question and ask it. 
  To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the instructor 
  will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:
