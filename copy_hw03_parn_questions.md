### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
    The given description for the forward method is "move the turtle forward by the specified distance, in the direction the turtle is headed". Another command that could be used is "fd". I am more used to forward than fd.
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
    the turtle.position or the turtle.pos can be used to print the turtle's current location.
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
   turtle.speed is used to control the turtle's speed and to get the maximum speed you would input turtle.speed(0), 0 is the fastest speed. 
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    turtle.color(xanadu) would be used to change the turtle's color to xanadu
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
    turtle.color(xanadu)
    turtle.begin_fill()
    turtle.circle(80)
    turtle.end_fill()
```

```
  the repository is what we are cloning and it exists on your local machine.  
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    Commit is where you want to save your project, when you want to make a change but you are not sure and you might want to revert the changes is when you use commit .It needs a commit message to indicate were changes were made since the last commit.
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    To push your code means to save your changes on the Github servers, so you or your partners can use the code to continue the software that's being created. Your code is being pushed from your computer to the Github server and your partners are pulling it from the server.
