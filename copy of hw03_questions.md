     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

   location?
   
```
    You can use the pos() method and the write() method to display the position
    while using the turtle module.
    
    example
    position = turtle.pos()
    turtle.write(position)
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    by using the speed(0) method with the value of 0.
```
