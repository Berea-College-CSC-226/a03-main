Please replace each `Replace this text with your answer` 
with your answer to the question above.

## SECTION 1: 

1.a. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color purple. 
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
   R(Red): 128
   G(Green): 0
   B(Blue): 128
```

1.b. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color brown. 
     What are the R, G, and B values? 

```
   R (Red): 165
   G (Green): 42
   B (Blue): 42

1.c. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color xanadu. 
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
   R (Red): 115
   G (Green): 134
   B (Blue): 120
```

### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
     'instead of saying 'turtle.forward' we can also say 'turtle.fd', its a shorter version of saying turtle.forward.
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
    turtle.position()
    turtle.pos()
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    turtle.speed(0)
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    turtle.color((115,134,120))
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
    begin_fill() and end_fill(), then you will put the code for the shape in between begin and end_fill.
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
   Cloning a repository (repo) means creating a local copy of a remote version-controlled project (often hosted on sites like GitHub).
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    A repository is the storage area for a project's files and version history. It may live locally on your system or remotely on services such as GitHub. Local and distant repositories can sync for working together.
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    A commit represents a snapshot of changes in a Git repository. A commit message summarizes the changes, allowing monitoring and communication.
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
   When you push your code, you are transferring changes from your local machine (local repository) to a remote repository (such as GitHub). This makes your updates visible to others or stores them centrally.
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    Pulling before pushing keeps your code up to current with the remote version, avoiding conflicts and coordinating changes.
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
    142 branches, yes I see others and mine as well.
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    Yes they are different.
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    When I checkout the master branch in PyCharm, the file remains visible but may return to its previous state if no changes were made.
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    Yes, the file returns when you switch back to your branch. Branching lets you work on different features separately, switch contexts easily, and experiment safely.
```

## SECTION 5
- A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully 
  understanding them. Your last task is to formulate a question and ask it. 
  To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the instructor 
  will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:

```
    I am not in a group on slack there is no way i can ask.
```
