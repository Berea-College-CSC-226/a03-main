### SECTION 2

     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

   location?
   
```

```

```
    turtle.speed(10)
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    Copying the repo without making any changes to the original
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    The repository is the main code that exists on github
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    It saves your changes and adds a message to tell other people what you have changed.
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    It will add the changes to a pull request on github, where the repositry owner can either accept the code into the master branch or highlight changes that need to be made.
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    So that your project is up to date and you can review the code so you don't overwrite or have a conflict with someone else's code.
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
    Theres a branch for every other students work. I don't see mine because I haven't pushed anything at this point.
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    Replace this text with your answer
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    Replace this text with your answer
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

## SECTION 5
- A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully 
  understanding them. Your last task is to formulate a question and ask it. 
  To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the instructor 
  will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:
