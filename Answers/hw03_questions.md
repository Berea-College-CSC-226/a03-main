     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
    turtle.position()
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    turtle.speed(0)
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    color(59,119,69)

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    Taking the original files and data from a version stored on Git servers and copying it to a local save on the computer
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    On the Computer it was downloaded on
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    Commits are when you push out what you coded and it is saved elsewhere so it can be pulled up through the link.
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    Pushing the code saves it to the Git servers under the repository link we copied. 
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    So that you can confirm it all matches and has no problems
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
    There are quite a few branches saved, I see mine and many others.
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    There are none of the files ive made or the changes ive saved. 
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    Replace this text with your answer, All of the uncommited files are showing to show me that they are still uncommited
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    My things are still here, it is important to branch so that many people can use the same code without making permanent changes to it.
```

## SECTION 5
- A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully 
  understanding them. Your last task is to formulate a question and ask it. 
  To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the instructor 
  will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:
