Please replace each `Replace this text with your answer` 
with your answer to the question above.

## SECTION 1: 

1.a. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color purple. 
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
    160,0,160
```

1.b. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color brown. 
     What are the R, G, and B values? 

```
    140,65,15
```

1.c. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color xanadu. 
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
    115,135,120
```

### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
    turtle.fd()
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
    turtle.position()
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    turtle.speed('fastest')
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    turtle.pencolor((115.0, 135.0, 120.0))
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
    turtle.fillcolor((115.0, 135.0, 120.0)) 
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    Taking the same document and placing it in a local/unshared area
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    The repository exists in Github
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    Commit is saving the most recent progress outside of the local device. A useful message informs what changes were made and why they are important.
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    The code is being shown to others in the repository and requesting to be added to the master branch. It sends it to Github.
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    This ensures that your code works with the already added code from other developers.
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
   18
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    Yes
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    It changes, but it lets me deicide what changes to add.
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    It allows me to see updates on the master code and see if they work with my code.
```

## SECTION 5
- A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully 
  understanding them. Your last task is to formulate a question and ask it. 
  To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the instructor 
  will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:

```
    Is there a better way to edit previously merged/pulled files after getting comments?
```
