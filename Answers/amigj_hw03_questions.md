```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
    turtle.position() or turtle.pos()
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    Setting the turtle's speed to zero, turtle.speed(0)
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    turtle.pencolor(138, 175, 147)
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
    turtle.fillcolor(138, 175, 147)
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    Making your own duplicate of the code.
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    A respository is where code and data is stored. It mainly exist on Github. In addition the programmer has a small and local repository in their machine.
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    A commit saves your work, and a commit message describes what the file contains or/and any changes made.
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    Pushing the code sends it to the Git repository from your local computer.
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    So your master is updated with the most recent changes/commits. 
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
    There are 145 branches, and I can see my and other's branches.
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    My branch is different because it doesn't have the most up to date information like is on the master.
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    My file is still there and didn't change unless I either merged the master to my branch or made changes to my branch.
    Though my file isn't in master unless my pull request was accepted.
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    My file is back. Having branching is useful to have to make edits that are seperate from the master, 
    and when you want your branch info in the master you can do a pull request.
```

## SECTION 5
- A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully 
  understanding them. Your last task is to formulate a question and ask it. 
  To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the instructor 
  will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:
