### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
    Move the turtle forward by the specified distance, in the direction the turtle is headed.
    I can use command turtle.fd(distance) or turtle.backward(-distance).
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
    turtle.position()
    Return the turtleâ€™s current location (x,y)
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    either turtle.speed(10) or turtle.speed('fast')
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    turtle.pencolor(115,134,120)
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
    turtle.fillcolor((115,134,120))   or  turtle.fillcolor('xanadu')
    turtle.begin_fill()
    ...
    turtle.end_fill()
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    Clonning means to make a copy of the project from the cloud to your local pc.
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    Repository is the space in the cloud where the project is saved. It exists in github and can be cloned to the local machine.
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    Commit is the git command to save changes in the project on your local machine. It needs a commit message, so you and other developers can understand what was changed. 
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    Push means submitting your code to the repository. It is being pushed from your local machine to the repository (git cloud)

## SECTION 5
- A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully 
  understanding them. Your last task is to formulate a question and ask it. 
  To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the instructor 
  will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:
